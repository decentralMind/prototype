Concept: Decentralize Voting system through 51% consensus mechanism.

    *Features*:
    * Communities will be responsible for managing smart contract in long run.
    * Communities can remove owner.
    * Communities can remove other communities.
    * Communities can change proposal expiry date time.

This system can fail as Communities could form majorities and hack the smart contract.
