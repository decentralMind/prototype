# Community ERC20

Main Idea: Each token should store infromation about communiy address and batch number.

Batch number is increased monntly basis. Registered community can only mint token once on each batch number.

This is just a prototype as array is very expensive to work with, possibly run out of gas for larger transaction.

Use it on Remix-ide.
