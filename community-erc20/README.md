# Community ERC20

Main Idea: Each token should store information about community address and batch number.

Batch number is increased on monthly basis. Registered community can only mint token once on each batch number.

This is just a prototype as array is very expensive to work with, possibly run out of gas for larger transaction.

Run it on Remix-ide.
