Concept: Decentralize Voting system through 51% consensus mechanism.
    Features:
    * Communities will be reponsible for managing smart contract in long run.
    * Communities can remove owner.
    * Communities can remove other communities.
    * Communities can change proposal expiry date time.
    
This system can fail as Communites could form majorities and hack the smart contract.
